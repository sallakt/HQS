# HQS
Game project, period 3
<br>
Changes after February 22nd are not running, and were only tests
<br>
NEW git at sallave/HQSgame
<br>
this was due to us working at the same time so much that the conflicts were at hundreds, so we decided to first try the Unity collab which we found to be too forceful deleting things, and then using the importing/exporting as packages until we were satisfied enough to get back on GitHub and a new repository
